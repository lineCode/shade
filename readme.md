# shade
shader-toy-like fragment shader development assistant tool. blockchain.

## why
it's like shader-toy, but with basically no features of shader-toy. but you can run it off-line, and not in a browser.

## usage
modify `fragment.glsl` as you see fit, checkout your shader with `make test`.

### fragment shader
the inputs to the fragment shader are the normalised coordinates of the viewport - i.e between 0 and 1, in `x` and `y`. this is different to shader-which gives you screen coordinates.

## todo

1. add some more features
